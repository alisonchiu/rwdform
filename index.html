<h3>The Importance of Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>
Responsive web design (RWD) enables users to have seamless experiences between different devices. This means that users can visit the same url and still have a consistent interactions on the website. Having separate sites for each experiences can make navigating the site harder because the patterns are not the same. When a user goes from desktop to mobile, or vice versa, they will likely assume the interactions are similar. </p>

<p>Allowing the content to adapt to different screen sizes also makes content more accessible and readable. For example, there is less screen space on a mobile device so images need to become larger than on a desktop or they will be difficult to view.</p>

<p>Another impact is that websites become more manageable because only one version of code needs to be maintained rather than two (more mobile and web) due to breakpoints and other contexts for responsiveness. </p>
